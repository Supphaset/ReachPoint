# ReachPoint HTTP API (draft v0.1, 12 Oct 2026)

What the web app calls in API mode (`VITE_DATA=api` or `?data=api`; see `web/src/data/mode.ts`). The starter server
in `api/main.py` implements all of it on an in-memory copy of `contract/seed/demo.hy-2025-11.json`, so the screens
work end to end before Firestore is connected. The friend's version keeps the same routes and shapes and moves the
records to Firestore, with each write in one transaction (pack §4.2).

Views are always built by `api/views` (the same functions that write `contract/fixtures`), so a screen that works on
the fixtures works on the server.

## Conventions

- JSON in and out. Times are ISO 8601 UTC (`2026-10-11T03:16:00Z`).
- Every write carries `submissionId` (random, from the client). Sending the same one again returns the first result
  and changes nothing (safe retry).
- A rule failure is **HTTP 409** with `{ "code", "message", "detail" }`. Codes: `ALREADY_TAKEN`,
  `NOT_ENOUGH_CAPACITY`, `NEED_CHANGED`, `ALLOCATION_CLOSED`, `VERSION_CONFLICT`, `NOT_AVAILABLE`, `INVALID`.
  `message` is shown to the user as is, so it is plain English ("Already taken by T-R").
- Unknown IDs are **404**. Bad input (missing field) is **422**.
- A successful write returns `{ "ok": true, "value": … }`; the client then fetches the affected view again.
- Sign-in is a demo role for now (`X-Demo-Actor: team:T-S`, `coordinator:demo-1`); Firebase Auth replaces it.

## Views (GET)

| Route | Returns | Built by |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/views/areaBriefing/{areaId}` | `AreaBriefingView` | `api.views.briefing.area_briefing` |
| `/api/views/teamMissions/{teamId}` | `TeamMissionsView` (open listings in the shared order, the team's jobs with exact points and medical notes) | `api.views.team.team_missions` |
| `/api/views/zoneOrder` | zone order + suggested checks | `api.views.desk.zone_order_view` |
| `/api/views/rain/{areaId}` | `RainStatus[]` for the replayed day (the screen picks the newest at or before its clock) | `api.views.desk.rain_view` |
| `/api/views/risingWater/{areaId}` | `RisingWaterView[]` for the replayed day | `api.views.desk.rising_water_view` |
| `/api/views/splitPanel` | `SplitPanelView` | stored suggestion (`allocationSuggestion` + What-ifs) |
| `/api/health` | `{ "ok": true, "store": "memory" \| "firestore", "seedVersion" }` | |

## Team actions (POST)

| Route | Body | Rules (all in one transaction) | `value` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/listings/{listingId}/claim` | `teamId`, `groupIds[]`, `expectedRevision` | team Available; capable; every group open; seats enough; revision unchanged | the new `Job` (with exact pickup and, for that team only, medical notes) |
| `/api/allocations/{allocationId}/window` | `start`, `end` | job open; set by its own team | — |
| `/api/allocations/{allocationId}/progress` | `state`: `on_the_way` \| `on_scene` | job open | — |
| `/api/allocations/{allocationId}/close` | `outcome`: `done` \| `already_left` \| `not_found` \| `needs_more_help` | job open; medical notes removed from the team's view (D38); `needs_more_help` reopens the groups | — |
| `/api/allocations/{allocationId}/hand-back` | `reason` | job open; groups reopen with "Back from T-x: reason"; seats return | — |
| `/api/teams/{teamId}/status` | `status`, `reason`, `backAbout` | reason and back-about cleared on Available | — |
| `/api/listings/{listingId}/reconfirm` | `teamId` | marks "re-confirm requested" for the desk | — |

## Desk actions (POST, coordinator)

| Route | Body | Rules | `value` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/listings/{listingId}/urgent-flag` | `reason`, `confirmedNow` | reason required (`INVALID`); tier 1b → RED on every team view; `needRevision` + 1; `confirmedNow` moves "last confirmed" to now (D42) | — |
| `/api/ask-teams` | `suggestionId`, `teamIds[]` | returns **200** with `AskResult`: `ok: false, code: VERSION_CONFLICT` and the current suggestion when the input changed (C7) | `AskResult` |

Still to add (friend): intake (`/api/intake/text`, call screen), desk review (approve / reject facts), zone missions
(`publishZoneMission`, `takeSegment`, `markSegment`), resident status (`/api/status/{token}`).
